# Scavengers
Scavengers was a multiplayer “co-opetition” – a team battle for survival set in a beautiful, frozen wilderness.

With limited resources, your team works together to complete objectives and scour a hostile world for improved gear, weapons and tools in a limited amount of time.

Starting players appear somewhat reluctant and tentative, but gain poise, confidence, and leadership in their journey towards adulthood, unraveling the mysteries of the world they find themselves in.
