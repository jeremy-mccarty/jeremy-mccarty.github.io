Hello there, my name is Jeremy McCarty!

I am a Senior Technical UI Designer at [Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/ "Bungie") working on [Destiny 2](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/NewLight "Destiny 2"). Previously: Technical UI Designer at [Midwinter Entertainment](https://midwinter.net/ "Midwinter Entertainment") on [Scavengers](https://www.playscavengers.com/en "Scavengers").

I stumbled upon my love for making games in 2013 and decided to move out to Washington to pursue that dream. In 2019, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Game Design degree from DigiPen Institute of Technology with a focus on technical design and production.

When I am not playing or working on games, I am likely skating, snowboarding, rock climbing, or enjoying the beautiful state of Washington with my family.
